# Introduction
This repository is just my practice haven. 
I just want to complete all of my beginner coding challenges to myself. 
These coding challenges are based on these websites:

https://www.practicepython.org/


I have listed 10 coding challenges:
1. Sort a list
2. Convert a decimal to binary
3. Just the numbers
4. Repeat the characters
5. Create a bus child
6. Password Generator
7. All Prime Numbers
8.
9.
10.

Sort a list: 
Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first will be a list of numbers. The second parameter will be a string that can be one of the following values: asc, desc, and none.
If the second parameter is “asc,” then the function should return a list with the numbers in ascending order. If it’s “desc,” then the list should be in descending order, and if it’s “none,” it should return the original list unaltered.

Convert a decimal to binary:
Write a function in Python that accepts a decimal number and returns the equivalent binary number. To make this simple, the decimal number will always be less than 1,024, so the binary number returned will always be less than ten digits long.

Just the numbers:
Write a function in Python that accepts a list of any length that contains a mix of non-negative integers and strings. The function should return a list with only the integers in the original list in the same order.

Repeat the Characters:
Create a Python function that accepts a string. The function should return a string, with each character in the original string doubled. If you send the function “now” as a parameter, it should return “nnooww,” and if you send “123a!”, it should return “112233aa!!”.

Create a bus Child:
Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.

Password Generator:
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your run-time code in a main method.
Extra: Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

All Prime numbers: 
Ask the user to enter a number. Then find all the primes up to that number.
